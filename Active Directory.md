# Microsoftâ€™s Active Directory

Active Directory (AD) is a directory service developed by Microsoft to authenticate users and computers in a Microsoft Windows domain. It comes as part of Windows Server. The computer running Windows Server controlling the domain is referred to as the domain controller. Red Hat Enterprise Linux can integrate with Active Directory domains as can Red Hat Identity Management, Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform, and other Red Hat products.

Active Directory relies on three core technologies that work together:

LDAP to store information about users, computers, passwords, and other resources
Kerberos to provide secure authentication over the network
Domain name service (DNS) to provide mappings between IP addresses and host names of computers and other devices in the network
