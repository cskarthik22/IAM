## Identity Provider

An identity provider (IDP) is the authoritative entity responsible for authenticating an end user.
```

An identity provider needs an identity store to retrieve users' information to use during the authentication and authorization process. Identity stores can be any type of repository: 
- Database 
- Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP), 
- properties file, and so on.
